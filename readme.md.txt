#### Description:

HI Message is a mailing app created for the final project of the course CS50x offered by the Harvard University. This app allows users to register, log in, and communicate with one another by text messages. It also allows the users to view the currently registered users. This software is created by the use of Flask, a web application framework written in Python. All error cases have been handled with high detailing upto my knowledge.

All the HTML files are contained in the templates folder. These include the index, inbox, user search, and message search templates. The styling done is contained in the static folder. The styling also includes snippets from the bootstrap framework. The database.db file contains all the essential data required for the proper functioning of the web app. It includes details such as users information, messages sent, etc.
